This is an example of how to integrate TestCafe into CucumberJS tests, which is provided for demonstration purposes only.
 
You can use this example at your own risk. I don't guarantee that it will work under all circumstances. I won't update, improve, or provide support for this example.
 
Please take a look at the existing community integration examples:
